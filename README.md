### 🙋‍♂️ About Me

#### If it is your first time here, I recommend you checkout my project WebGuide.Space. I started building Webguide after I found myself constantly forgetting what resources I had discovered or used on personal projects. Built with TypeScript, React, Context API, Tailwind CSS and Supabase, Webguide has drawn 6,000+ page views and 200+ returning visitors. I continue to improve the site based on user feedback and add resources I love to use each day. I couldn't have imagined more than just me using it, so I am grateful for its (small) success.

#### One of the keys to my success as a builder is my love of learning. I seek learning how I can improve the software development skillset I already have and how the new technologies available can make my code more efficient.
