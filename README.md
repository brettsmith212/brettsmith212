### 🙋‍♂️ About Me

#### I love to build. When I was 9 years old I helped design a mock Lunar Colony with other classmates at an inter-school competition. While I never ended up going to the Moon, I did discover a love for designing the future. The future I now create is in the digital world. I develop, build and maintain web applications that are modern and intuitive. 

#### One of the keys to my success as a builder is my love of learning. I seek learning how I can improve the software development skillset I already have and how the new technologies available can make my code more efficient. I am very proud of the work I have done to master the technical skills necessary for building in the digital age. 

#### My favorite personal project that showcases my technical skillset is definitely Webguide. I started building Webguide after I found myself constantly forgetting what resources I had discovered or used on personal projects. Built with TypeScript, React, Context API, Tailwind CSS and Supabase, Webguide has drawn 6,000+ page views and 200+ returning visitors. I continue to improve the site based on user feedback and add resources I love to use each day. I couldn't have imagined more than just me using it, so I am grateful for its (small) success.
