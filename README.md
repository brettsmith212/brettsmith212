# Hi, I'm Brett

### Full Stack Web Developer

### I love to build. When I was 9 years old I helped design a Mars Colony with other classmates at a multi-school convention. While I never ended up going to Mars, I did discover a love for wanting to design the future. The future I now design is in a digital world. I develop, build and maintain web applications that provide value to users. 

### One of the keys to my success as a builder is my love of learning. I seek learning how I can improve the software development skillset I already have and how the new technologies available can make my code more efficient. I am very proud of the work I have done to master the technical skills necessary for building in the digital age.
