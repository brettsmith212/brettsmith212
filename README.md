# Hi, I'm Brett

## Full Stack Web Developer

> I love to build. When I was 9 years old I helped design a Mars Colony with other classmates at a multi-school convention. While I never ended up going to Mars, I did discover a love for wanting to design the future. The future I now design is in a digital world. I develop, build and maintain web applications that provide value to users.
