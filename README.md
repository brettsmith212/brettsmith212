### 🙋‍♂️ About Me

#### I love to build. When I was 9 years old I helped design a mock Lunar Colony with other classmates at an inter-school competition. While I never ended up going to the Moon, I did discover a love for designing the future. The future I now create is in the digital world. I develop, build and maintain web applications that are modern and intuitive. 

#### One of the keys to my success as a builder is my love of learning. I seek learning how I can improve the software development skillset I already have and how the new technologies available can make my code more efficient. I am very proud of the work I have done to master the technical skills necessary for building in the digital age.
